## üìö Study Guide & Best Practices

#### üß† **System Design Interview Strategy**

```
1. üìã Requirements Gathering (5 minutes)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Functional requirements
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Non-functional requirements  
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Scale estimation
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Constraints and assumptions

2. üé® High-Level Design (10 minutes)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Core components identification
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API design
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Database schema
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ System architecture diagram

3. üîß Detailed Design (15 minutes)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Component deep-dive
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Data flow explanation
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Algorithm choices
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Technology selections

4. üéØ Scale & Optimize (10 minutes)
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bottleneck identification
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Scaling strategies
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Performance optimizations
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Monitoring and metrics
```

### üèÜ **Best Practices & Design Principles**

#### ‚ö° **Performance Optimization**
- **üîç Identify Bottlenecks Early**: Profile and monitor system performance
- **üìä Optimize for Actual Usage**: Design based on real traffic patterns
- **üíæ Cache Strategically**: Implement multi-level caching where appropriate
- **üîÑ Async Where Possible**: Use asynchronous processing for non-critical paths

#### üõ°Ô∏è **Reliability & Resilience**
- **üéØ Design for Failure**: Assume components will fail and plan accordingly
- **üîÑ Implement Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascade failures
- **üìà Gradual Rollouts**: Deploy changes incrementally
- **üîç Comprehensive Monitoring**: Monitor all critical system metrics

#### üìà **Scalability Guidelines**
- **üìä Horizontal > Vertical**: Prefer scaling out over scaling up
- **üîÑ Stateless Services**: Design services to be stateless when possible
- **üìù Database Partitioning**: Use sharding for large datasets
- **‚öñÔ∏è Load Distribution**: Distribute load evenly across services

### üõ†Ô∏è **Common System Design Patterns**

| üé® **Pattern** | üéØ **Use Case** | üìù **Description** |
|------------|--------------|------------------|
| **üîÑ CQRS** | Read/Write Separation | Separate command and query responsibilities |
| **üìÖ Event Sourcing** | Audit Trail | Store events rather than current state |
| **üèóÔ∏è Microservices** | Service Decomposition | Break monolith into smaller services |
| **üåê API Gateway** | Service Aggregation | Single entry point for client requests |
| **üíæ Database per Service** | Data Isolation | Each service owns its data |
| **üîÑ Saga Pattern** | Distributed Transactions | Manage long-running transactions |

### üìä **Key Metrics to Consider**

#### üéØ **Performance Metrics**
- **Latency**: p95, p99 response times
- **Throughput**: Requests per second (RPS)
- **Availability**: Uptime percentage
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests

#### üí∞ **Business Metrics**
- **Cost per Transaction**: Infrastructure cost efficiency
- **Development Velocity**: Time to market for features
- **Operational Overhead**: Maintenance and support costs

### üéì **Interview Success Tips**

1. **üéØ Ask Clarifying Questions**: Don't assume requirements
2. **üìä Think Out Loud**: Explain your thought process
3. **üîÑ Iterate and Improve**: Start simple, then add complexity
4. **üìà Consider Trade-offs**: Discuss pros and cons of decisions
5. **üõ°Ô∏è Address Failure Scenarios**: Show you think about edge cases
6. **üí¨ Communicate Clearly**: Use diagrams and clear explanations
